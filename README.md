# Tetris
Tetris game based on Ania Kubow's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/aniakubow

# Context
I built this Tetris game in an effort to test and improve my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript after predominantly focusing on React.js. By using Ania Kubow's tutorial as a guide, this project allowed me to flex my new skills, while also learning more about the logic involved in game development as well as encountering new built in functions.

You can play the game here: https://kamari-a.github.io/tetris/

# Next Steps
My next steps for this project are:
- to convert my code to ES6 syntax
- generate the div's in the html file dynamically using a looped array
- fix the bug that will occassionally freeze the tetrominoes where they are generated
