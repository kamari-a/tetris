# Tetris
Tetris game based on Ania Kubow's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/aniakubow

# Context
I built this Tetris game in an effort to test and improve my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript after predominantly focusing on React.js. By using Ania Kubow's tutorial as a guide, this project allowed me to flex my new skills, while also learning more about the logic involved in game development as well as encountering new built in functions.

# Next Steps
My next steps for this project are to convert it to ES6 syntax, and fix the bug that will occassionally freeze the tetrominoes where they are generated.
